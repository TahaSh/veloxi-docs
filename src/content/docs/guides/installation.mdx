You can install Veloxi using your favorite package manager.

PNPM:

pnpm install veloxi
```

NPM:

```bash
npm install veloxi
```

Yarn:

```bash
yarn add veloxi
```

Then, import it like this:

```js
import { createApp } from 'veloxi'

const app = createApp()
```

## Using Veloxi from CDN

You can include it directly in a script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/veloxi/dist/veloxi.min.js"></script>
```

Then, you can access its exports using the `Veloxi` global variable:

```js
const app = Veloxi.createApp()
```
