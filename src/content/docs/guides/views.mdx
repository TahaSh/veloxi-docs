import PluginCode from '@components/PluginCode.vue'

Instead of directly dealing with the DOM, Veloxi simplifies the handling of its elements by providing an easy, yet effective API for manipulation and animation.

## Creating Views

There isn't a dedicated API for manually creating views in Veloxi. Instead, Veloxi automatically generates views when you specify the element for which you want to create a view.

To achieve this, you use the `data-vel-view="yourViewName"` attribute. However, it's essential to remember that a view remains inactive until it's associated with a specific plugin. To establish this association, you need to use the `data-vel-plugin="yourPluginName"` attribute on the same element.

Here's an example illustrating the creation of a view named `circle`, which is used within a plugin called `FollowMousePlugin`:"

```html
<div data-vel-view="circle" data-vel-plugin="FollowMousePlugin"></div>
```

Then you can access it in your plugin like this (for more details, check out our [plugin guide](http://localhost:4321/guides/plugins/#accessing-views)):

<PluginCode client:load>
  <div slot="FunctionalStyle">
    ```js
    import { createApp } from 'veloxi'

    const FollowMousePlugin = (context) => {
      context.setup(() => {
        const circle = context.getView('circle')
      })
    }
    MyPlugin.pluginName = 'FollowMousePlugin'

    const app = createApp()
    app.addPlugin(FollowMousePlugin)
    app.run()
    ```

  </div>
  <div slot="ClassicalStyle">
    ```js
    import { createApp, Plugin } from 'veloxi'

    class FollowMousePlugin extends Plugin {
      static pluginName = 'FollowMousePlugin'

      setup() {
        const circle = this.getView('circle')
      }
    }

    const app = createApp()
    app.addPlugin(FollowMousePlugin)
    app.run()
    ```

  </div>
</PluginCode>

## View Properties

Every view object comes with a set of properties that you can both retrieve and modify. Currently, the supported properties include:

- **Position**: Specifies the x and y coordinates of the view on the page.
- **Scale**: Determines the scaleX and scaleY properties of the view, corresponding to [transform's scale properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scale).
- **Size**: Represents the actual width and height of the view.
- **Rotation**: Denotes the degree of rotation for the view, along the z-axis.

Each view property is an object that contains a list of methods and fields that enable you to read and update its values.

In the upcoming sections, we will examine each property in detail and explore how to retrieve and modify their values.

### View Position

To access the position property, you can use `view.position`. Each view begins with an initial position on the page, which you can retrieve using `view.position.initialX` and `view.position.initialY`.

```js
// This will have the initial position based on where the element was rendered in the DOM
const initialX = myView.position.initialX
const initialY = myView.position.initialY

// This will have the current position after it's moved
const currentX = myView.position.x
const currentY = myView.position.y
```

To change the position of a view, you can use the `set({ x, y }, runAnimation?)` method for that.

```js
// Move the view to the position x: 200px, y: 400px on the page
myView.position.set({
  x: 200,
  y: 400
})

// Move the view to the position x: 400px and keep y the same
myView.position.set({
  x: 400
})

// Move the view to the position y: 600px and keep x the same
myView.position.set({
  y: 600
})

// Move the view to the specified x and y positions with animation (the default)
myView.position.set(
  {
    x: 100,
    y: 100
  },
  true
)

// Move the view to the specified x and y positions without animation
myView.position.set(
  {
    x: 100,
    y: 100
  },
  false
)
```

Here's how you can reset the view's position to its initial position:

```js
const initialX = myView.position.initialX
const initialY = myView.position.initialY

myView.position.set({
  x: initialX,
  y: initialY
})

// Or simply call reset(runAnimation? = true)
myView.position.reset()
```

You can find out how close the view is to a particular point as a percentage. This percentage ranges from 0 to 1. It starts at 0 and goes up as the view gets nearer to the target point. This calculation is based on the view's starting position.

```js
// Here's a target point, or you can get it from another view
// using { x: view.position.x, y: view.position.y }
const targetPoint = { x: 500, y: 200 }

// This will range from 0 to 1. It will be 0.5 when it's halfway to the target.
const percentage = myView.position.progressTo(targetPoint)
```

### View Scale

Scaling in Veloxi works in a way similar to adjusting the [transform's scale property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scale) in CSSâ€”essentially, it applies these values to the CSS scale property

So, the scale values (scaleX and scaleY) start at 1 for the initial size. If you set them to 0, the view disappears, and if you set them to 2, the view doubles in size. You can use `view.set({ x, y }, runAnimation?)` to change these values.

Sometimes, we don't want to think about relative values like the ones mentioned above. Instead, we just want to resize using specific width and height values. That's exactly what `view.setWithSize({ width, height }, runAnimation?)` is for.

Let's look at some usage examples:"

```js
const currentScaleX = myView.scale.x
const currentScaleY = myView.scale.y

// Grows its size to double (with animation)
myView.scale.set(
  {
    x: 2,
    y: 2
  },
  true
)

// Reduces its width to half (while keeping the height the same) without animation
myView.scale.set(
  {
    x: 0.5
  },
  false
)

// Change the scale to whatever value makes the view width 200px and height 500px
myView.scale.setWithSize({
  width: 200,
  height: 500
})

// Change the scale to whatever value makes the view width 200px and height 500px
myView.scale.setWithSize({
  width: 200,
  height: 500
})

// Change the scale to whatever value makes the view height 400px while keeping scaleX the same
myView.scale.setWithSize({
  height: 400
})

// Reset scale to scaleX = 1 and scaleY = 1 with animation
myView.scale.reset(true)
```

### View Size

The size properties allow you to both retrieve and modify the width and height of the view.

Here are some code examples:

```js
const currentWidth = myView.size.width
const currentHeight = myView.size.height

const initialWidth = myView.size.initialWidth
const initialHeight = myView.size.initialHeight

const currentWidthAfterScale = myView.size.widthAfterScale
const currentHeightAfterScale = myView.size.heightAfterScale

// Set width to 500px and height to 200px
myView.size.set({
  width: 500,
  height: 200
})

// Set width to 200px while keeping height at the initial value
myView.size.set({
  width: 200
})

// Reset width and height to initial values
myView.size.reset()
```

### View Rotation

In the current version, Veloxi only supports rotation along the z-axis. You can set and get values in either radians or degrees.

Here are some code examples:

```js
const rotationInDegrees = myView.rotation.degrees
const rotationInRadians = myView.rotation.radians

// With animation
myView.rotation.setDegrees(45)
// Without animation
myView.rotation.setDegrees(45, false)

// With animation
myView.rotation.setRadians(0.1)
// Without animation
myView.rotation.setRadians(0.1, false)
```

## View Animators

Animation plays an essential role in UI interaction, and Veloxi simplifies its use by encapsulating all animation configurations within an object called `animator`.

You can directly access the animator object for any [view proprety](/guides/views/#view-properties) you wish to animate, such as position, scale, size, and rotation.

For instance, if you want to apply animation to the position property, you can invoke the `set(animationName)` method on its animator, like this:

```js
myView.position.animator.set('spring')
```

From that point onward, whenever the position of that view changes, it will use the spring animator for animation.

By default, animation is disabled for all properties. This is because the default animator type used is `instant`, which effectively means 'no animation.'

Currently, Veloxi supports the following animation types:

- **instant**: No animation.
- **tween**: Animation with a defined start and end, with control over its duration and easing function.
- **dynamic**: Tailored for real-time responsive interactions, such as following the mouse or dragging. You can control its speed.
- **spring**: Applies spring animation, with adjustable parameters for _stiffness_, _damping_, and _speed_.

Let's take a look at some code examples:

```js
// Dynamic animator with default speed
myView.position.animator.set('dynamic', { speed: 15 })

// Spring animator with default values
myView.size.animator.set('spring', {
  stiffness: 0.5,
  damping: 0.75,
  speed: 10
})

// Tween animator with default values
myView.scale.animator.set('spring', {
  duration: 500, // 500ms
  ease: (t) => t // linear easing function
})

// Instant animator doesn't have config values
myView.rotation.animator.set('instant')
```

## View Data

If [emitting events](/guides/plugins/#emit-events) is how plugins communicate with the outside world, _View Data_ is the method for communication in the opposite direction.

When building real-world applications, there's typically some app or component state that manages the UI. Regardless of whether you're working with a framework or vanilla JavaScript, it's recommended to handle updates to that state outside of Veloxi. Instead, use Veloxi exclusively for creating interactions related to those state changes.

For instance, imagine you have a dropdown component that users can open and close with [some cool animation](https://codepen.io/tahazsh/full/yLGKLqa). Clicking the top-level item in the dropdown should expand all nested items. At this point, you have two options: you can either respond directly to the click event and update the UI using CSS or JavaScript, or you can toggle a flag (or set some data) to indicate the change and let Veloxi handle the UI update and animation.

For the latter, you can use _View Data_ to communicate the change to Veloxi.

In Veloxi, you can transmit data to views using a data attribute on the element, like this: `data-vel-data-prop-name="propValue"`. In this notation, `prop-name` can be any name you choose, and `propValue` can be any value you want.

Within your plugin, you can access this data using `myView.data.propName`. Notice how we use camel case for the data name.

In the context of the dropdown example, you can pass the current state of the dropdown to this data attribute, like so:"

```html
<div
  class="dropdown"
  data-vel-plugin="DropdownPlugin"
  data-vel-view="container"
  data-vel-data-is-open="false"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

And then, you can access that **isOpen** data in the _DropdownPlugin_.

<PluginCode client:load>
  <div slot="FunctionalStyle">
    ```js
    import { createApp } from 'veloxi'

    const DropdownPlugin = (context) => {
      let dropdownContainer
      context.setup(() => {
        dropdownContainer = context.getView('container')
        // The open state data
        const isOpen = isOpen()
      })

      // Put the access code in a function to make it dynamic
      function isOpen() {
        return dropdownContainer.data.isOpen === 'true'
      }
    }

    DropdownPlugin.pluginName = 'DropdownPlugin'
    DropdownPlugin.scope = 'container'

    const app = createApp()
    app.addPlugin(DropdownPlugin)
    app.run()
    ```

  </div>
  <div slot="ClassicalStyle">
    ```js
    import { createApp, Plugin } from 'veloxi'

    class DropdownPlugin extends Plugin {
      static pluginName = 'DropdownPlugin'
      static scope = 'container'

      dropdownContainer

      setup() {
        this.dropdownContainer = this.getView('container')
        // The open state data
        const isOpen = this.isOpen
      }

      // Put access code in a getter to make it dynamic
      get isOpen() {
        return this.dropdownContainer.data.isOpen === 'true'
      }
    }

    const app = createApp()
    app.addPlugin(DropdownPlugin)
    app.run()

    ```

  </div>
</PluginCode>

## Other View Fields

### `element`

Returns the DOM element for the view.

```js
const element = myView.element
```

### `hasElement(element: HTMLElement): boolean`

Returns a boolean indicating whether a view contains a specific DOM element.

```js
if (myView.hasElement(someElement)) {
  // do something
}
```

### `getScroll(): { x: number, y: number }`

Returns the current horizontal and vertical scroll positions for the view on the page. It's similar to getting the page scroll using `window.scrollY` and `window.scrollX`, but it also takes into account any scrolling happening inside a parent container, if there is one.

See how it's used in [Follow-The-Mouse example](/examples/follow-the-mouse/).

```js
const { x, y } = myView.getScroll()
```

### `intersects(x: number, y: number): boolean`

Returns whether a point (x and y) falls inside the view.

```js
const clickPosition = { x: 100, y: 200 }
if (myView.intersects(clickPosition)) {
  console.log('clicked on the view')
}
```

### `overlapsWith(view: View): boolean`

Returns whether the view overlaps with another view.

```js
if (myView.overlapsWith(otherView)) {
  console.log('Both views overlap')
}
```

### `distanceTo(view: View): number`

Returns the distance between two views in pixels.

```js
const distance = myView.distanceTo(otherView)
if (distance > 100) {
  // If the distance between both views is greater than 100px, do something
}
```
